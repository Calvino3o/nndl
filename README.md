An assignment demo for the lesson deep learning I took in LDU.
ALKBH5_Baltz dataset is about RAN sequence, and our purpose is to predict what protein sequence will be produce by these RAN sequence. However, the task is so challenging that the accuracy is always at a low level no mattter I use what kind of neural networks. But I'm confident that the deeper net can not performs better results.
